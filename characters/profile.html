                  A formidable Rhyll warrior skilled in all forms of combat,
                  Ghost is one of the Generals of the Rhyll Dominion. His
                  citadel lies upon a snowy mountain to the North-east of the
                  realm. In addition to his impressive combat skills, Ghost also
                  has the ability to heal rapidly, to the extent that he can
                  regenerate lost limbs, making him an even more daunting
                  opponent. While fearsome in battle and merciless to his
                  enemies, he is far more kind and sympathetic towards those
                  under his rule. However, he despises traitors and will not
                  hesitate to strike down those who have wronged him. He has no
                  patience for incompetence and is disgusted by weak, cowardly
                  warriors.

                  Ailithir lived for the most of his youth within the
                  Illuminated City, the capital of the Lunaris realm. By his
                  birthright, he was chosen to become the next Silver Sage
                  (which is basically the cat pope/high priest of his race). As
                  the first son of the prestigious and powerful Silver family,
                  he led a happy and uneventful life, at least for the first ten
                  years of his existence, studying and training under the former
                  Silver Sage. However, when he was ten years old, his mother
                  died giving birth to his youngest brother, Sakar. To make
                  things worse, Sakar was born with pure black fur, which
                  basically made him the Anti-Christ of Lunarian society. His
                  father became paranoid that Sakar's existence would be
                  discovered, which would not only bring disgrace to their proud
                  family name, but also put Sakar at risk of being murdered by
                  crazy superstitious Lunarians. He locked Sakar up in a small
                  room within their mansion, charged Ailithir with the role of
                  taking care of him, and made him promise to never let Sakar
                  leave the house. Ailithir grew very close to Sakar, as he was
                  the only person other than their father that Sakar had any
                  interaction with. Ailithir often told Sakar stories of the
                  beautiful outside world, which ignited a deep curiosity within
                  the younger cat. When Sakar asked Ailithir to bring him out,
                  Ailithir could not refuse. They did not wander far, and were
                  soon found by their father. Their father, upon discovering
                  that Ailithir had went against his wishes and put his
                  brother's life at risk, flew into a rage and struck Ailithir.
                  Ailithir, who previously had never been hit or punished, was
                  deeply traumatized by this incident.

                  Ailithir started spending more time away from home and in the
                  company of his mentor, the former Silver Sage, who was a close
                  family friend as well. Rumours of unrest within the
                  neighbouring Rhyll Dominion began to spread, which culminated
                  in a visit from the leaders of the Rhyll. The Rhyll asked for
                  the Lunaris to spare them some land, for their territories
                  were slowly being encroached on by a mysterious plague that
                  left their earth barren and their water poisoned. However, the
                  Lunaris declined their request, for their realm was already
                  too small and would surely be overpopulated if they allowed
                  the Rhyll to move in. Out of desperation, the Rhyll attacked
                  the Lunaris realm, determined to seize the territory and save
                  their people. As the Captain of the Lunaris Guard, Ailithir's
                  father went away to join the war. However, the Lunaris forces
                  were easily defeated by the far more combat-ready Rhyll.
                  Eventually, the Rhyll army arrived at the Illuminated City,
                  with Ailithir's father in tow as a prisoner. At the gates of
                  the city, before an audience of horrified Lunaris (with
                  Ailithir among them), they killed Ailithir's father and
                  threatened the Lunaris to surrender, or they will do the same
                  to the rest of them. The former Silver Sage ordered what was
                  left of the Lunaris forces to defend the city, but it was a
                  lost cause and the city was seized overnight. The Rhyll killed
                  and imprisoned many members of the Lunaris noble families, but
                  Ailithir was able to escape. Terrified, lost and completely
                  helpless, Ailithir stumbled through the wilderness for weeks,
                  trying to survive and evade capture. Eventually, Ailithir
                  encountered a small group of deserters from the Rhyll
                  Dominion, or rebels as they called themselves. They saved
                  Ailithir from a Rhyll patrol and unaware of Ailithir's
                  identity, they took him in, even though their leader, Caden,
                  had his reservations. They traveled together for a few months,
                  and Ailithir almost believed that he can start a new life with
                  them, completely abandoning his devastated realm. However,
                  mistakes were made and a majority of the group was captured by
                  the Rhyll, leaving only Ailithir and Caden behind. Ailithir
                  offered to help Caden to save his friends, and the two of them
                  ventured to the nearest Rhyll outpost where they were sure the
                  prisoners would be taken. Ailithir managed to help Caden's
                  friends escape, but he gets captured himself. The Rhyll
                  tortured him and demanded for him to tell them the location of
                  a rumored secret Lunaris base, where a rebellion had begun.
                  Ailithir, however, refused to tell them anything, so he was
                  thrown back into a cell and left to await his execution.

                  After the war, Ailithir placed all his efforts into helping to
                  rebuild his realm. Eventually, the realm started to prosper
                  once more, entering a new Golden Age. Ailithir, finally able
                  to return to his more passive role of being a priest, rebuilt
                  his mansion into an orphanage for children orphaned during the
                  war, and adopted a young orphaned girl by the name of Hilda.
                  He settled down in a small cottage by the sea with his new
                  family and all was well. <br /><br />
                  He wished. <br /><br />
                  Ailithir, on a diplomatic trip to the Hanwi Islands,
                  encountered a Hanwi priestess. Both were fascinated by the
                  others' powers, and after spending some time together, the two
                  became very close. The priestess revealed herself to be Ieya,
                  the Hanwi goddess of harvest. Ieya offered to create a child
                  for him, a devastatingly powerful being who would be the
                  culmination of both of their powers. Without understanding her
                  real motives, Ailithir refused, but Ieya was adamant. One day,
                  she simply vanished, leaving behind a demigod child on
                  Ailithir's doorstep that Ailithir had no choice but to care
                  for. As the Silver Sage, Ailithir was forbidden from marrying
                  or having children, or else he was required to pass up his
                  duties. Hence, when Ailithir returned with the child, Solius,
                  the Lunarian council was outraged. However, since Ailithir had
                  no apprentice, and there was no one suitable to replace him,
                  he was pardoned. Solius, on the other hand, had to suffer
                  through a childhood of prejudice and insults. <br /><br />
                  Ailithir loved Solius and raised him to the best he could. He
                  secretly hoped that Solius would be the one to replace him as
                  the next Silver Sage, but Solius adamantly refused to study
                  magic, even though he demonstrated incredibly powerful magical
                  abilities at a young age. <br /><br />
                  When Solius turned 14, a mysterious visitor arrived at the
                  Illuminated City. The visitor, a self-proclaimed powerful
                  sorcercer from the North started to teach Ailithir about dark
                  magic and asked Ailithir to "join him in building a new world
                  together". Slightly frightened, Ailithir rejected his offer.
                  Things escalated and the sorcerer revealed himself to be
                  Sakar, who had really been kidnapped and brought to the North,
                  where he made a deal with a god to grant him powers beyond
                  imagination should he do the god's bidding. Angry at
                  Ailithir's rejection and believing that Ailithir had betrayed
                  him once more, the sorcerer attacked Ailithir. At this point,
                  Solius ran in to help his father, but the sorcerer only turned
                  his attack on Solius. In trying to protect Solius, Ailithir is
                  fatally wounded. With his dying breath, he gave Solius a
                  locket containing a picture of Solius' mother, imploring
                  Solius to seek her out.
